Incident Reports

This section contains cybersecurity incident response reports based on simulated or real-world styled scenarios. Each report follows a standard IR structure: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

These reports demonstrate analytical thinking, defensive response strategy, and the ability to communicate technical findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
