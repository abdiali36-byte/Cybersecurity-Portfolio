Security Automation and Scripting

This section contains Python and PowerShell scripts created to automate security tasks, support SOC workflows, and improve investigation efficiency.

Example automation areas may include:

- Log parsing and filtering
- IOC extraction using regex
- VirusTotal, Shodan, or API lookups
- Automated case evidence export
- Bulk file or log manipulation
- Enrichment of alerts with contextual data

The focus is on building small, practical tools that support Blue Team operations rather than large engineering projects.
