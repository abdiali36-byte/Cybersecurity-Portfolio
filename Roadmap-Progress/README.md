## Skills Gained or Improved
- Statistics and log filtering concepts
- Understanding MFA prompts vs fatigue attacks
- Recognising DNS exfiltration behaviours
- Sentences must be specific, not “learned a lot”

---

## Challenges Faced
- Which topics slowed progress?
- Where did you need extra support?
- What was unexpectedly difficult?

Example:
"Struggled with KQL joins when correlating logs."

---

## How Challenges Were Overcome
- Resources used
- People consulted
- Re-attempted labs

---

## Goals for Next Progress Period
- [ ] Complete next Security+ section
- [ ] Automate IOC lookup script
- [ ] Create first Cloud Security case study

Make goals measurable.

## Reflection (Journal Format)
*A short paragraph — what this period taught you personally.*

Example:
"This week I realised alert triage is more about logical elimination than technical depth. Understanding the context around logs makes investigations faster."
