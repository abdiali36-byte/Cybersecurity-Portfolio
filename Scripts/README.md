Automation Scripts

A collection of helper and automation scripts created during my cybersecurity learning journey. These may include:
- PowerShell scripts for log collection
- Bash scripts for Linux automation
- Python utilities for parsing or manipulating data

The goal is to demonstrate practical workflow automation skills used in SOC environments.
